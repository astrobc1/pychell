Installation
************

From GitHub
===========

pychell relies on the optimize package and can be downloaded from GitHub as well.

``git clone https://github.com/astrobc1/pychell``
``git clone https://github.com/astrobc1/optimize``

Change directories into the head pychell directory, and install with

``pip install .``

Then do the same for the optimize package.
