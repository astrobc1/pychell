Installation
************

From GitHub
===========

pychell relies on the optimize package which can also be downloaded from GitHub.

| ``git clone https://github.com/astrobc1/pychell``
| ``git clone https://github.com/astrobc1/optimize``

Change directories into the head pychell directory, and install with

``pip install .``

Then do the same for optimize.
