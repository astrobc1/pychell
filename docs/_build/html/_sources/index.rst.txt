1. Reduce and extract multi-order, multi-trace echelle spectra.
2. Generate relative radial velocities for stellar sources.
3. Fit orbital and stellar activity models to radial velocities.

This website contains pychell tutorials, the pychell API, and instructions to provide support for new spectrographs.
